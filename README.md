# Hi, I'm James Steinbach!

Like I just said, I'm James (he/him) and I'm a front-end architect. I like building sites and web apps with *well-organized code*, *accessible UIs*, and *quick performance*.

## Skills

I like focusing on core technologies (the basics, some would say). That foundation has enabled me to adapt quickly to other frameworks, CMSes, and build tools.

### Foundational Expertise

* HTML (semantics & accessibility)
* CSS (with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) & [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/))
* User Experience (design, contrast, typography)
* JS

### Tools I Like

* [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
* [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) (occasionally)

## Hobbies

If you're interested, I like doing lots of things besides development. (I firmly believe in doing excellent work during reasonable hours and protecting my non-work time.)

* 📚 I'm an avid reader.
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I love spending time with my family.
* 🧩 I enjoy jigsaw puzzles, Lego, and Nanoblocks.
* 🎮 I play a few video games and watch some TV.

## Get in Touch

I tweet infrequently at [@jdsteinbach](https://twitter.com/jdsteinbach) and there's a [contact page on my blog](https://jdsteinbach.com).

Whenever conferences start happening in-person again, I'm usually at couple front-end conferences each year and I enjoy meeting Internet friends in person.
