# James Steinbach

> Well, hello there, friend!

I'm James (you already read that thoughâ€¦) and I'm a front-end architect. I like building sites and web apps with *well-organized code*, *accessible UIs*, and *quick performance*.

## Skills

I like focusing on basics - that's enabled me to adapt quickly to other frameworks, CMSes, and build tools.

### Basics

* HTML (semantics & accessibility)
* CSS (with PostCSS & Sass)
* User Experience (design, contrast, typography)
* JS

### Tools I Like

* Eleventy
* Stencil
* Vue, React, Ember
* WordPress

## Hobbies

If you're interested, I like doing lots of things besides development. (I firmly believe in doing excellent work during reasonable hours and protecting my non-work time.)

* I'm an avid reader.
* I love spending time with my family.
* I enjoy jigsaw puzzles, Lego, and Nanoblocks.
* I play a few video games and watch some TV.

## Get in Touch

I tweet infrequently at [@jdsteinbach](https://twitter.com/jdsteinbach) and there's a [contact page on my blog](https://jdsteinbach.com).

Whenever conferences start happening in-person again, I'm usually at couple front-end conferences each year and I enjoy meeting "Internet friends" in person.
