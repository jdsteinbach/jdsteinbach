# Hi, I'm James Steinbach!

Like I just said, I'm James (he/him) and I'm a senior softwarefront-end architect. I like building sites and web apps with *well-organized code*, *accessible UIs*, and *quick performance*.

## Hire Me

I'm actively looking for a new role now. Check out my [resume](https://jamessteinbach.com/resume) and [reach out](mailto:hi@jamessteinbach.com) if you're interested in working together!

## Skills

I like focusing on core technologies (the basics, some would say). That foundation has enabled me to adapt quickly to other frameworks, CMSes, and build tools.

### Foundational Expertise

* HTML (semantics & accessibility)
* CSS
* JS
* User Experience (design, contrast, typography)

### Tools I Like

* [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
* [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)
* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
* [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) & [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Hobbies

If you're interested, I like doing lots of things besides development. (I firmly believe in doing excellent work during reasonable hours and protecting my non-work time.)

* 📚 I'm an avid reader.
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I love spending time with my family.
* 🧱 I enjoy [building LEGO](https://instagram.com/drbrickhaus) and solving jigsaw puzzles.
* 🎮 I play a few video games and watch some TV.

## Get in Touch

I tweet infrequently at [@jdsteinbach](https://twitter.com/jdsteinbach) and there's a [contact page on my blog](https://jdsteinbach.com/contact/).

I try attending front-end conferences when I can, and I enjoy meeting Internet friends in person.
